For this section you will be creating your own project README with your group. Your README should have

A title

Your group members names

An image of your code playing PacMan

A section on how to run the code from the command line

include a code block

A list of the functions you wrote with

a description of the implementation for each function

a description of the test you wrote

The descriptions don't have to be long - a sentence or two would suffice.

Feel free to be creative and add any other elements. For example, you could

add a video of your code playing PacMan instead of an image

add small code blocks that supplement your descriptions

add a table of contents for your readme

These aren't required, but could be interesting to explore.
